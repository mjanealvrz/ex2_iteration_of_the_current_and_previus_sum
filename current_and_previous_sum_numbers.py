#Write a program to iterate the first 10 numbers, and in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.

#Pseudocode

# Set a starting point
# Set the previous number to 0
# # Create an loop for 10 numbers that is even numbers  (start = 0, stop = 20, step = 2)
    # Create an arithemtic expression to express the sum of previous and current number
    # Print the values 
    #Update the previous_number for the next iteration
